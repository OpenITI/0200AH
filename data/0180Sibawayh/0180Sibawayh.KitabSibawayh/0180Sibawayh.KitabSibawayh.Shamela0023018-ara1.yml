90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This edition includes some of the marginal commentary
    by al-Akhfash al-Awsat according to Schoeler "The genesis of Literature
    in Islam", p. 89. This may be either in footnotes or in the body text, I
    haven't checked this. Poetry has been tagged, including half-lines where
    I spotted them. Titles have been put on one line. I have kept all
    headers at first level, but there may actually be a subdivision from
    v03p192 onwards, although if I understand correctly from the footnote,
    this is a volume-division taken from the Bulaq edition. Someone with a
    better understanding of the text might want to impose some hierarchy
    here.  REDUNDANT_PARTS: Lines 13351-13373 do not appear at this place in
    the pdf and create an abnormally long page. I have noticed no other
    obvious gaps (but also wasn't looking for one), so this part may need to
    be deleted.  The PDF page order was messed up between pages 260-290 of
    the second volume (these pages are substituted by later pages which
    appear again further on in the pdf) so I have annotated according to
    textual logic here.  Text is generally of pretty good quality, but I
    came across a few small cases of word variation between pdf and digital
    text: line 50 has akhadha-hu instead of rawa-hu. Line 406 "akhir" is not
    part of pdf. Also quite often the chapter-titles are just "bab" in the
    digital text, but in the PDF most often you find "hadha bab". This last
    divergence is especially present in the fourth volume. I have also
    spotted a few typos here and there.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 363, 388, 1472,
    4204, 4369, 4526, 20780
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 9612, 12829
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Body text separated from the titles. The redundant part reported by the annotator was duplicate and therefore removed. 2- The first chapter of the text which is about Sibawayh, the author of the text, and his place in Arabic grammar is not written by him. it is written by the transmitter of the text. So, I tagged this section as PARATEXT.  3- The comments by al-Akhfash, which the annotator points out, are added as footnotes (beginning with “Abu al-Hasan”) by the editor of the text. Since the digital text does not include the footnotes, this is not a problem. 4- All headers were first-level. I added some levelling to the headers. However, I didn’t read the text, and my levelling is just to the extent that the structure of the text can be inferred from the titles. Many of the successive headers are relevant to a specific subject, but the problem is that there is no parent category to cover them. A specialist must read the text closely and correct the levelling by adding headers in square brackets.
