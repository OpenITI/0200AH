90#VERS#COMMENT##:	The text is in good order and closely corresponds to the printed edition. I had to remove a few editorial parts, like footnotes. The entire first volume of the printed edition is editorial material. The annotations (bāb, kitāb, etc) all appeared at the top of the page rather than where they were located in the printed edition. I used the search function to replace all the ones I did not do while skimming the text.
