90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text is in good order and closely corresponds to the
            printed edition. I had to remove a few editorial parts, like footnotes. The
            entire first volume of the printed edition is editorial material. The
            annotations (bāb, kitāb, etc) all appeared at the top of the page rather than
            where they were located in the printed edition. I used the search function to
            replace all the ones I did not do while skimming the text.
           NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): No changes.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
