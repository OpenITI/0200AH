90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Marzieh Tofighi Darian (SHARIAsource-CnC)
90#VERS#COMMENT##: First, This collection is organized around books (kitab) and then chapters (bab). However, the title of first two books even thoguh mentioned in the table of content do not exist in the PDF and subsequently in the digital version. So, all the headings were treated as level 1 in red color. I have changed all chapters (bab) to 2nd level (orange color) and retian all books (kitab) headings in red. For example, v 1 p 15 is the start of Kitab al Tihara but it is not mentioned in the text of print version and the digital. Second, The text in general corresponds to the PDF except in the following instances in which a portion or the entire page is missing: v.2 p. 175, v. 2 p. 355, v. 2 p. 509 heading a sentence after that is missing, v. 3 p. 67 there is a heading in the digital version that does not exist in the PDF, v. 3 pages 320, 321, 324, 325, 329, 332,333 and 518 are missing. Third, the other major problem with the text is that there are editorial additions in the text of the PDF, these comments exist in the digital version, sometimes they appear with the paranthesis and sometimes the paranthesis do not exist in the digital version but the comment in the text exists. This will be problematic as it mixes the original author's words and the editor's. and there is no consistency with paranthesis in the digital version. For example see V. 3 p 80. Finally, there were very few instances of pagination mixed up that I corrected (2-3 instances) and also very few instances of random numbers in the text that I removed. [SPL: The 'editorial parentheses' are generally very short interjections (a word or two) and are unlikely to cause problems; there are a number of pages that only contained footnotes and these page divisions have not been retained in the text, but they are not missing pages even though it appears the consistency of paging is interrupted; replaced missing sections, as detailed above, with OCR.]
