90#VERS#COMMENT##: The PDF that I found is exactly the same edition that
            is used in the Editpro text. So, the METADATA can be completed according
            to the book information. 2- All page numbers in the text must be added
            by one. 3- I tagged the names as ### $ when just one name appears at the
            beginning of a sentence in complete form, and I tried to tag all the
            names that could be tagged structurally; however, there are a lot of
            other names inside the sentences that could not be tagged structurally.
            4- Some titles are written separately and bold in the book, but they
            don’t seem to me to be major categories really. I tagged them with an
            asterisk (i.e. ### || *). 6- The categorization of the book does not
            seem to be thorough. Some names, for example, don’t seem to belong to
            their category, but they seem to belong to the former category. So, the
            text probably needs a few invented titles to have a perfect
            categorization. 7- A missing paragraph in page 32.
    All paratextual elements
