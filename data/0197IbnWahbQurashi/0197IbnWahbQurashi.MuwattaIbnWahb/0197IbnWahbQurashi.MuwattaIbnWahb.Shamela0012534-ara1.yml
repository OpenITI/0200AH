90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is a transcription of a manuscript of part
    of Ibn Wahb's Muwaṭṭa. The editor states in his introduction 
    that he first thought it was a part of his Kitāb al-Jāmiʿ,
    but comparison with that text and quotations from the Muwaṭṭa
    convinced him that this is a part of the Muwaṭṭaʾ.
    The text file does not include editorial material.
