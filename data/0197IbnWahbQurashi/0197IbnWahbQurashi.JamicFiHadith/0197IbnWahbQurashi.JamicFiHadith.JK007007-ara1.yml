90#VERS#COMMENT##: Transcription of a third-century papyrus manuscript from Edfu
    (Dār al-Kutub, Fihris Ḥadīth raqm 2201, see editor's intoduction p. 28).
    The editor indicates in the introduction (p. 29-30) that the text has specific
    sections,
    but not all of them are indicated in the text.
    PV tagged the sections marked in the text (but other sections
    mentioned by the editor in the introduction were not located).
    All paratextual elements (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
