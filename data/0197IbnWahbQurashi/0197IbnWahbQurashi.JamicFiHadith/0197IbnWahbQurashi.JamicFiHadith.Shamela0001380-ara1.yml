90#VERS#COMMENT##: Transcription of a third-century papyrus manuscript from Edfu
    (Dār al-Kutub, Fihris Ḥadīth raqm 2201, see editor's intoduction p. 28).
    The editor indicates in the introduction (p. 29-30) that the text has specific sections,
    but not all of them are indicated in the text.
    The page numbers are in Shamela's ṣafḥa format at the top of each page.
    The section numbers are often inserted after an introductor "qāla".
